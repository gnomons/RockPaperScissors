# RockPaperScissors
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player console game

This code is a simple implementation of the popular game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". The code uses the random module to generate the computer's move and allows the player to input their move using the keyboard. The code then compares the player's move and the computer's move and prints the result to the console.

To use this code, run the script and follow the instructions in the terminal. When prompted, enter r for rock, p for paper, or s for scissors to make your move. The code will then generate the computer's move and determine the winner of the game. The result will be printed to the console.

This code is a simple example of how to use the random module to generate random numbers and how to compare user input in a basic game. It can be a useful starting point for learning how to write Python code and for experimenting with different ways of implementing the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game.
